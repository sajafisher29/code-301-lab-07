# code301-lab06-back-end
Node, npm, and Express Repo Initiation (*to be updated) 

## Project title

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Motivation
In labs 6 through 9, you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, you will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Every day, you and your new partner(s) will deploy your back end as a new instance on Heroku.

You will have access to view the code base for the client, but will not be able to modify it in any way.

For this lab assignment, you will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 through 9, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.
