# code301-lab06
Node, npm, and Express Repo Initiation (*to be updated) 

## Project title

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Motivation
In labs 6 through 9, you will be building a stand-alone back end which will interact with a static front end. Working with a new partner each day, you will request data from a total of six third-party APIs, modify the data as needed, and send the data to the client to be displayed in the browser. In labs 8 and 9, you will be persisting data in a SQL database.

Every day, you and your new partner(s) will deploy your back end as a new instance on Heroku.

You will have access to view the code base for the client, but will not be able to modify it in any way.

For this lab assignment, you will convert a location entered by the user into a latitude and longitude, then use those values to request weather information for that location. As your City Explorer back end progresses in labs 6 through 9, you will use the latitude and longitude to request information from other APIs from the same search query.


## Build status
We will be using the Trello project management tool for the duration of this project.
To maximize your experience with Trello, you should create a free Trello account by clicking on the Sign Up button.
After creating an account, go to the City Explorer Trello Board, open the “… Show Menu” link, click the “… More” link, and then click “Copy Board”. Before you create it, be sure to “Change” from Private to “Public” (and click “Yes, Make Board Public”) so your instructional team can see your work. Now, click “Create” to add a copy to your personal account.
This Trello board contains all of the features required to complete this lab assignment.
Also on the Settings tab, click the “Filter” link to view just the current day
With your partner, review the user stories and analyze the feature requests and requirements in the lab.
Within each story, note the acceptance criteria (“Given … When … Then…”) and the checklist of feature tasks. Be careful to execute tasks in order as they are often dependencies of one another.
During the day with your partner, check off tasks as you complete them, and move the story cards through the workflow.
